### Description ###

I once bet my cousin that I spoke to my parents for at least half an hour a day on average and that I could write a script in 30 miniutes that would prove it.  This is that script.

Like most of my projects, this was written with a time limit.  As a result, the quality of code is not great.  I misses some important things such as:<br>
<ul>
<li>The fact that I may not speak to my parents every day</li>
<li>The usage of the datetime library which would have made life much easier</li>
<li>Comments on the code</li>
<li>Function definitions that I wrap around blocks of logical code instead of a single monolithic script</li>
</ul>
<br>
Like most of my projects, this was written as proof of concept.  I never took it any further.

I don't bite :)
